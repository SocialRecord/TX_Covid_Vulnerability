# Capstone Project

For this project, we will examine several socioeconomic factors such as access to healthcare, access to food, and income level for each county in Texas. We will overlay known areas of infection with the CDC's Social Vulnerability Index (pictured below) to look for trends that may explain why certain counties have a higher number of cases than others. Our goal is to help educate the community on the social characteristics that may make a county more likely to have a second wave of COVID.


## Executive Summary:


## How to Reproduce:
- Have python installed through anaconda
- Clone this repo

## Initial Hypotheses
#### Vulnerability Score
- $H_0$: Vulnerability score is not related to higher infection rate.
- $H_a$: Vulnerability score is related to higher infection rate

#### Population Density
- $H_0$: Population density correlates to higher infection rate
- $H_a$: Population density does not correlate to higher infection rate 

#### Senior Citizens
- $H_0$: Counties with higher population of senior citizens have higher infection rates
- $H_a$: Counties with higher population of senior citizens do not have higher infection rates


## Deliverables
- presentation via video (slides and oral presentation for general audience)
- Tableau dashboard
- On GitHub repo:
    - Jupyter notebook
    - Readme file
    - acquire.py
    - prepare.py
    - wrangle.py
    - explore.py
    - preprocessing.py
    - model.py



## Project Planning:

**Acquisition, Prep, and Initial Exploration**
* Read in various files
* Created various new dataframes to get aggregated value counts for counties
* Handle Missing Values
* Remove/repair erroneous data
* Look at shape of data

**Exploration**
Answer the following questions:
1. What social features are related to spikes in COVID

**Modeling**
- Time Series Analysis - Using our social vulnerability index we want to create a model to show weekly growth/decline of COVID per county
- We will use classification, time series, and possibly regression to predict case increases

## Data Dictionary

## Nice to Have
1. Website

## Technical Skills
- Python (including internal and third party libraries)
- Hypothesis testing
- Machine Learning (Time series, classification, clustering, regression)
