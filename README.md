# Capstone Project

This analysis incorporates data pooled from several federal and state sources to determine if socioeconomic factors, such as poverty and access to food, can explain the prevalence of COVID-19 cases in Texas counties. The unique data set allowed the team to focus on smaller counties to help identify their vulnerability to COVID-19. Itâ€™s crucial to identify these vulnerable counties before their healthcare systems are crippled by this social virus.

__Take a look at [our website](https://thesocialrecord.com) to interact with our dashboards and find more information about each team member__ 


## Executive Summary:
We took previously unliked data from state and federal sources and combined it together to study the interactions between social factors and COVID-19 cases in Texas. 
After just under 2 weeks of analysis, there found there were interesting relationships between:
> - Minority Status
> - State ordinances
> - Population size
> - Proximity to either meatpacking plants and/or transportation routes.

Those relationships revealed vulnerabilities in counties with higher __infection percent__ that are less obvious when we were  just looking at counties with __higher case counts__.



## How to Reproduce:
- Have python installed through anaconda
- Clone this repo

## Initial Hypotheses
#### Vulnerability Score
- $H_0$: Vulnerability score is not related to higher infection rate.
- $H_a$: Vulnerability score is related to higher infection rate

#### Population Density
- $H_0$: Population density correlates to higher infection rate
- $H_a$: Population density does not correlate to higher infection rate 

#### Senior Citizens
- $H_0$: Counties with higher population of senior citizens have higher infection rates
- $H_a$: Counties with higher population of senior citizens do not have higher infection rates


## Deliverables
- presentation via video (slides and oral presentation for general audience)
- Tableau dashboard
- On GitHub repo:
    - Jupyter notebook
    - Readme file
    - acquire.py
    - prepare.py
    - wrangle.py
    - explore.py
    - preprocessing.py
    - model.py



## Project Planning:

**Acquisition, Prep, and Initial Exploration**
* Read in various files
* Created various new dataframes to get aggregated value counts for counties
* Handle Missing Values
* Remove/repair erroneous data
* Look at shape of data

**Exploration**
Answer the following questions:
1. What social features are related to spikes in COVID

**Modeling**
- Time Series Analysis - Using our social vulnerability index we want to create a model to show weekly growth/decline of COVID per county
- We will use classification, time series, and possibly regression to predict case increases


## Technical Skills
- Python (including internal and third party libraries)
- Hypothesis testing
- Machine Learning (Time series, classification, clustering, regression)
